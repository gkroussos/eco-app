Dave Durbin Updates
-------------------
Extracted XML parsing to separate set of classes in new package uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.db.xml
  DataVersionContentHandler is a SAX ContentHandler subclass for the version XML
  SiteListContentHandler is a SAX ContentHandler for the Site list XML
  
 Created DatabaseUpdater and DatabaseUpdaterListener classes in uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.db to isolate update 
 specific code in its own class and break the tight coupling between the progress bar and update which previoulsy existed in 
 the EcoAppActivity class
 
 Removed redundant main.xml and renamed all activity and Layouts to have consitent and meaningful names
 
 Renamed EcoAppActivity to SplashScreenActivity and refactored code to improve readability.
 
 Created uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.activity package and moved all Activities into it.
 
 Modified EcoAppSQLiteDatabaseOpenHelper to add a method to return the list of all Sites and then removed redundant 
 code from the various views in which it appeared.

 Current Known Problems
 ----------------------
 Maps not correctly downloading patches - seems to be an API key issue based on Googling/Stack Overflow. API v1 (the one in use) 
 has been deprecated as of Dec 2012 and no new keys to be issued from 3rd March 2013 (about when the app stopped working though I would have
 thought it should have continued to be OK)
 Site icons not being loaded - they never were. I've implemented an Async loader class but not put it to work yet
