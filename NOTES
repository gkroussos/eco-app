Dave Durbin Updates
-------------------
Extracted XML parsing to separate set of classes in new package uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.db.xml
  DataVersionContentHandler is a SAX ContentHandler subclass for the version XML
  SiteListContentHandler is a SAX ContentHandler for the Site list XML
  
 Created DatabaseUpdater and DatabaseUpdaterListener classes in uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.db to isolate update 
 specific code in its own class and break the tight coupling between the progress bar and update which previoulsy existed in 
 the EcoAppActivity class
 
 Removed redundant main.xml and renamed all activity and Layouts to have consitent and meaningful names
 
 Renamed EcoAppActivity to SplashScreenActivity and refactored code to improve readability.
 
 Created uk.ac.bbk.dcs.ecoapp.activity package and moved all Activities into it.
 
 Modified EcoAppSQLiteDatabaseOpenHelper to add a method to return the list of all Sites and then removed redundant 
 code from the various views in which it appeared.

 Current Known Problems
 ----------------------
 Maps not correctly downloading patches - seems to be an API key issue based on Googling/Stack Overflow. API v1 (the one in use) 
 has been deprecated as of Dec 2012 and no new keys to be issued from 3rd March 2013 (about when the app stopped working though I would have
 thought it should have continued to be OK)
 Site icons not being loaded - they never were. I've implemented an Async loader class but not put it to work yet
 Note by William Linden:
 I managed to generate keys using the old API, looks like it was still possible and it seems to work now, even on phones.
 
 
 Notes on Lombok
 ---------------
 Lombok is used to generate boilerplate code, like getters & setters. 
 A lightweight Lombok api has been generated and added into libs (libs/lombok-api.jar).
 Generated as stated here for Android: 
 http://projectlombok.org/setup/android.html  
 
 For Eclipse to understand the Lombok anotations, it should work to simply download the latest jar from: 
 http://projectlombok.org/download.html. Run the jar (it is an executable), it will try to detect any Eclipse installations, and select the installation 
 that you would like to have Lombok installed into. If it finds no installations automatically, simply browse to your eclipse.exe file using 
 the "Specify Location" button after running lombok.jar.
 
 For convenience and in case of future compatibility issues, a working lombok.jar file has been added into res/raw.
 This lomkob.jar file IS NOT part of the source code, it is only there for IDE updating.
